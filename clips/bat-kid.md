Miles Scott is a cancer survivor from Tulelake, in northern California near the border of Oregon. He was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia – a form of leukemia, or cancer of the white blood cells characterized by excess lymphoblasts – at 18 months old.

In chemotherapy treatment for several years he is now in remission, and the celebration is in honor of his completing treatments, the last one in June 2013. His mother shared that the decision was made to wait until the treatments were complete so that Miles would be strong enough for the day, and also it gave him something to look forward to while undergoing treatments. "This wish has meant closure for our family and an end to over three years of putting toxic drugs in our son's body," she said on the Make-A-Wish site. 

During his treatments Miles was "fascinated with superheroes. They were crimefighters and saviors. And they always won in the end." When the San Francisco Make-A-Wish asked Miles what he wanted more than anything else, he replied, "I wish to be Batman."
