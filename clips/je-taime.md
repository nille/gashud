# Lara Fabian - Je t'aime

> This was Lara's first performance after her significant other died.  She was obviously struggling a bit with emotion when this song started and missed the cue after the intro, so the audience started singing to her.  On top of this, if you listen the audience aren't singing "Je t'aime" (I love you) as the song goes, but "Nous t'aime" - - - "We love you" as a message of support for Lara.
